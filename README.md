# What is PyCaret?
PyCaret is an open-source, low-code machine learning library in Python that automates machine learning workflows. 
It is an end-to-end machine learning and model management tool that exponentially speeds up the experiment cycle and makes you more productive.

Compared with the other open-source machine learning libraries, PyCaret is an alternate low-code library that can replace hundreds of lines of code with a few lines only. This makes experiments exponentially faster and more efficient. PyCaret is essentially a Python wrapper around several machine learning libraries and frameworks such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, spaCy, Optuna, Hyperopt, Ray, and a few more
